# always_hungry_reactApp
Joint project with Randy Manraj

This is an app idea I had with a fellow bootcamp student where we use a restaurant API (documenu.com) to fetch a list of restaurants based on zip code

The returned list can be organized by: 
  -Restaurant Type
  -Food Type
  -Price level ("$" = low cost, and "$++" = higher cost)
  -Distance from zip code.
  
The app also uses a second API call to create a Google Maps clone, using Mapbox (mapbox.com), to offer directions to restaurant of choice from current location.

Future project goals:
  - Render the map only once you're logged in
  - Prepopulate the results onto the map
